# ACNAL
ACNAL(Astral Common Native Abstraction Layer) is a C++ library built on top of the native OS APIs. The library is open-source(MIT) and will be the fondation of the AstralX development framework.

ACNAL goal is to interface native APIs through a tin layer, making a solid independant base that is still giving lowlevel access in a more clean way than using for exemple win32, DirectX, Vulkan and such directly.

The longterm plan is to do some of those things:
* Wrapper around the Windows COM system so that it is a lot easier to use.
* Platform independance layer, so that common interfaces can be use for multiple native API with still low access to specifics features.
* Wrappers and interfaces around the popular graphics APIs(DirectX11,DirectX12,Vulkan & Metal).
* Common GUI development layer.
* And More.

# The project is on hold for the moment, i am actively working on some other projects like [the Rippen project](https://github.com/lagacy/Ripen), [Gawire](https://github.com/lagacy/Gawire-Project) and most of all on a BIG game with my company Deuzspark Technologies Inc. I will find time to continue my opensource projects incrementaly.
