# ACNAL
ACNAL(Astral Common Native Abstraction Layer) is a C++ library built on top of the native OS APIs. The library is open-source(MIT) and will be the fondation of the AstralX development framework. 

# The project is on hold for the moment, i am actively working on some other project like [the Rippen project](https://github.com/lagacy/Ripen), [Gawire](https://github.com/lagacy/Gawire-Project)(https://github.com/lagacy/Ripen) and most of all on a BIG game with my company Deuzspark Technologies Inc. I will find time to continue my opensource projects incrementaly.
